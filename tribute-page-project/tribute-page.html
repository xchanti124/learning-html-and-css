            Erwin Smith's Life
          </p>
          <p class="main-content">
            Erwin Smith was the 13th commander of the Survey Corps while in his late 30s. He was portrayed as an intelligent and competent commander who deeply cared about his army, yet did not hesitate to sacrifice them for the greater good. His appearance was commanding, standing tall above most members of the Survey Corps, and he had a generally muscular build with blonde hair. Most of the time, Smith did not show emotion and had a serious,  planning, and calculating expression on his face.

            Erwin Smith's Personality
          </p>
          <p class="main-content">
            Erwin Smiths personality was complex and might be best described as stoic. He was trusting of his army, yet was the first one to notice a spy among them. An eloquent speaker, Erwin was able to sway many people, such as the military tribunal held to judge Eren and the trainees into choosing which recruitment branches to join. Despite his desire to understand the truth of the world being stronger than humanity's victory, Erwin made the selfless decision to go charging in the front lines alongside his soldiers and sacrifice the chance of knowing what was in the basement, effectively abandoning his dream.
